## Purpose
Your Manager seeks to solve the problem of group organization and coordination of up-and-coming musical acts. This web application allows a user to be part of multiple bands and view all of the information they need to stay organized on one dashboard. Most importantly, users can keep track of all of their musical events on the same calendar on their dashboard and they can communicate to their band members about those events.
Your Manager also supports marking messages as read and unread, editing user and band information, and uses jwt to authenticate users.
Your Manager is an app created during the Full Stack Coding Bootcamp at Case Western Reserve University. 

## How to Use
In order to use our app and server hosted on Heroku, you simply need to make a user, and either create a band or enter in a pre-shared key from an existing band.
In order to run our app locally on your own computer, we would recommend forking our repo, git cloning to your computer, running npm I through vscode's terminal window, and opening another terminal tab. In one, run 'node server', and in the other you can run 'npm run serve'. Click the link served back to you by the terminal window and you should be good to go.
